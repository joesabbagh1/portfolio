  Nabu is a Java-based Android application that was developed in collaboration with a class partner for a mobile development course. It utilizes SQLite and Firebase for authentication and database management.

  The aim of the application is to help users manage their tasks and schedules efficiently. It includes features like task creation, scheduling, and reminders. Firebase was implemented for authentication purposes, ensuring the security of the user's data.

  Nabu has gained some traction on GitHub, with 20 stars and contributions from several members of the open-source community. We were asked to publish it on IzzyOnDroid (an open source alternative to google play) by one of its maintainers.
