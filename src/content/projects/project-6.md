title: Review and Rating Platform
description: |-
  Developed and designed a user-friendly website that allows users to review, rate and save their favorite restaurants, coffee shops and bars.

  I used Next.js, Tailwind, tRPC and Prisma for my stack. Deployed the website using AWS ECS on an EC2 instance using Docker for containerization, and Postgres for the database. Images were stored in an S3 bucket and served with CloudFront.
