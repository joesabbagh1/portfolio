  Developed in collaboration with a class partner for a mobile development course. The aim of the application is to help users manage their tasks and schedules efficiently. We used Java for the UI and SQLite for local storage and Firebase for online storage and for authentication.

  Nabu has gained some traction on GitHub, with 20 stars and contributions from several members of the open-source community. We were asked to publish it on IzzyOnDroid (an open source alternative to google play) by one of its maintainers.
