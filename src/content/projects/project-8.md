title: Ridesharing App
description: |-
  I'm currently working on a motorcycle-focused app similar to Uber, which is still in development. The frontend is built using React Native, while the backend utilizes Go and is hosted on AWS. This project serves as a learning experience for efficiently managing some traffic on the backend and implementing scalable solutions with AWS, as well as gaining proficiency in the Go programming language.
